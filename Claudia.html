    My name is Claudia Cadavillo, I am an intern at i.c.stars Chicago- learning as much as I can about programming and the tech world! I was born on September 20, 1994, in the city of Manila, Philippines. I've grown up using computers and the internet all my life, but I've only recently taken a deep-dive into learning how it all works and it's been a very fun ride so far!

   <h3 style="color:darkslategrey;">How to Season a Cast Iron Skillet with Rajiv Surendra</h3> 
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mjwvbQWR6DU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p style="color:darkslategray;">When I watch this video, I am motivated to grow my cast iron collection, and maybe buy an especially rusty skillet to season to <b>perfection</b>. I find Rajiv Surendra is a great instructor and teacher because not only is he thorough in instruction, but he has a knowledge of the history in the topics he is covering. <b>It is my belief that informing ourselves to the objects we use in our daily lives helps us appreciate what we have, makes us smarter consumers and we live more sustainably in the process.</b></p>

    <p>What I've learned in i.c.stars is. . .</p>
    <ul>
        <li>I've learned how to use Visual Studio Code to make my webpage</li>
        <li>Who you know helps as much as what you know when putting a foot into the tech career</li>
        <li>The Whistlestop Cafe is not a good time</li>  
    </ul>
