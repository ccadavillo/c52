   <section class="motivation"> <p>When I watch this video, I am motivated to grow my cast iron collection, and maybe buy an especially rusty skillet to season to <b>perfection</b>. I find Rajiv Surendra is a great instructor and teacher because not only is he thorough in instruction, but he has a knowledge of the history in the topics he is covering. <b>It is my belief that informing ourselves to the objects we use in our daily lives helps us appreciate what we have, makes us smarter consumers and we live more sustainably in the process.</b></p></section>
